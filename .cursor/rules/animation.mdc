- Animation Guidelines

  - Keep your animations fast and responsive for better user experience.

- Animation Speed

  - Default to use `ease-out` for most animations.
  - Animations should never be longer than 1s (unless illustrative).
  - Most animations should be around 0.2s to 0.3s.

- Easing Rules

  - Don't use built-in CSS easings unless it's `ease` or `linear`.
  - Use the following easings for their described use cases:

  - ease-in (Starts slow, speeds up)

    - Should generally be avoided as it makes the UI feel slow.
    - `ease-in-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.55, .085, .68, .53)`
    - `ease-in-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.550, .055, .675, .19)`
    - `ease-in-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.895, .03, .685, .22)`
    - `ease-in-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.755, .05, .855, .06)`
    - `ease-in-expo`: `cubic-bezier(.95, .05, .795, .035)`
    - `ease-in-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.6, .04, .98, .335)`

  - ease-out (Starts fast, slows down)

    - Best for elements entering the screen or user-initiated interactions.
    - `ease-out-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.25, .46, .45, .94)`
    - `ease-out-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.215, .61, .355, 1)`
    - `ease-out-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1)`
    - `ease-out-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.23, 1, .32, 1)`
    - `ease-out-expo`: `cubic-bezier(.19, 1, .22, 1)`
    - `ease-out-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.075, .82, .165, 1)`

  - ease-in-out (Smooth acceleration and deceleration)

    - Perfect for elements moving within the screen.
    - `ease-in-out-quad`: `cubic-bezier(.455, .03, .515, .955)`
    - `ease-in-out-cubic`: `cubic-bezier(.645, .045, .355, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-quart`: `cubic-bezier(.77, 0, .175, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-quint`: `cubic-bezier(.86, 0, .07, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-expo`: `cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1)`
    - `ease-in-out-circ`: `cubic-bezier(.785, .135, .15, .86)`

- Hover Transitions

  - Use the built-in CSS `ease` with a duration of `200ms` for simple hover transitions.
  - Simple transitions include: `color`, `background-color`, `opacity`.
  - Fall back to easing rules for more complex hover transitions.
  - Disable hover transitions on touch devices with the `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` media query.

- Accessibility

  - If `transform` is used in the animation, disable it in the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
  - Respect user preferences for reduced motion.

- Origin-Aware Animations

  - Elements should animate from the trigger.
  - If you open a dropdown or popover, it should animate from the button.
  - Change `transform-origin` according to the trigger position.

- Performance Optimization

  - Stick to opacity and transforms when possible.
  - Animate using `transform` instead of `top`, `left`, etc. when moving elements.
  - Do not animate drag gestures using CSS variables.
  - Do not animate blur values higher than 20px.
  - Use `will-change` to optimize your animation, but only for: `transform`, `opacity`, `clipPath`, `filter`.
  - When using Motion/Framer Motion, use `transform` instead of `x` or `y` for hardware acceleration.

- Spring Animations

  - Default to spring animations when using Framer Motion.
  - Avoid using bouncy spring animations unless working with drag gestures.
  - Spring animations provide natural, physics-based motion.
